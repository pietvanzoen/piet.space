  A female voice is singing in an operatic style in russian. The voice echos around the tunnel.

  There's some russling of my clothes as I walk past the singer.

  When I turn the corner the singing becomes quieter and you hear footsteps as I climb the steps.

  The singing continues to get quieter as the sounds from the street above get louder.

I was in Minsk for work. On my walk back to the hotel I could hear singing coming from one of the pedestrian tunnels going under the main road. I took a diversion and recorded as I walked through the tunnel.

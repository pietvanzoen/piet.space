  <summary>Audio Description</summary>
  <p>People chatter and walk around a busy market.</p>
  <p>An ambulance is making it's way through the busy city traffic.</p>
  <p>Shop keepers and customers greet each other and speak in French. "Bonjour!"</p>
  <p>The ambulance passes by grows quieter before it disappears.</p>
  <p>I ask Keven "What did you get?". She replies, "Some cherries, from that hot french guy."</p>
  <p>Keven's mom laughs and comments "They did look delish!"</p>
  <p>We enjoy the cherries and walk through the market.</p>
  <p>Keven's mom notices something she doesn't like the look of. "Eeeew! Is that squid?!"</p>
  <p>Market noises and french chattering continues.</p>

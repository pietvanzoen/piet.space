    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The summer we moved to the Netherlands the was lovely. As we were settling into our new lives we got to enjoy some beautiful sunny days. The evenings, however, were different. With all the heat and humidity came these amazing lightening storms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still 25+ degrees centigrade but outside it was pouring. We loved it. We would lay on our bed with the window open, listening to the rain, watching the flashes, and waiting for the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month we were away for the weekend at a vacation house. After a full day escaping the heat at the swimming pool, we settled into our quiet evening. It began to pour outside, and with it came the thunder and lightening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headphones on and volume up for the full effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently took a flight from Amsterdam to London. The flight time is only 40 minutes, but before that there's a 20 minute taxi from the terminal to the runway. You cross a motorway and a canal to get this runway. It's in the middle of a field far from any buildings besides a small control tower. This runway is the Polderbaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right next to the &lt;a href="https://www.schiphol.nl/en/you-and-schiphol/page/planespotting/"&gt;Polderbaan&lt;/a&gt; there's a carpark that's a really nice spot to watch (and hear) the planes landing or taking off. I finally took Teddie there to watch the planes. We got there and Teddie was more interested in playing in the car or running around the carpark, which was fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this recording of a Boeing 747 landing. As it's passing the recorder it kicks in the reverse thrust. Teddie held on to my legs as the noise went by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. This is also the first post using my new &lt;a href="https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/zoom-h1n-handy-recorder"&gt;Zoom H1n&lt;/a&gt; recorder. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On this day in 2009 Keven and I met a small group of friends and family at the McMenameins Edgefield Hotel in Oregon. We gathered together in a shady part of the gardens and said a few words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother brought his camcorder. He recorded everything for my mum who couldn't make it half way across the world with only two weeks notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could hear children playing and people enjoying their drinks at the outdoor bar nearby. It wasn't the most private cerimony, but it was a space for us.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently rediscovered this old recording I made in February 2006.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was visiting my mum and step-dad in Minehead in the UK. I brought my guitar and my 2006 white MacBook with me. I'd been playing around with a song for a while and decided to put a recording together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I layered about 5 guitar pieces together, all recorded using the MacBook microphone. At one point you can hear the fan from the laptop kick in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song is called &lt;em&gt;Less Ordinary&lt;/em&gt;, I have no idea why. Maybe I got it from the film &lt;em&gt;Life Less Ordinary&lt;/em&gt;. I might have liked that film at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember pretty distinctly listening to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woods_(album)"&gt;Sleater-Kinney's &lt;em&gt;The Woods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the first time on this trip. My song is nothing like Sleater-Kinney, but somehow these two things are related in my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On national windmill day we came across an art performance in a field by a windmill. It was a mix of ambient audio coming from speakers attached to the sails of the windmill accompanied by a harp and poetry recitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short recording from that performance.&lt;/p&gt;

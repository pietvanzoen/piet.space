  An accordion plays over the low rumbling of the metro train.

  As the train approaches a station the station name is announced.

  The doors of the train open and people step on and off the train.

  The accordion player finishes his song and thanks everyone for listening. "Merci beaucoup!"

  Coins clink in the bottom of his cup as he asks for tips.
